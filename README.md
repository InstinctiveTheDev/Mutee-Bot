# Mutee Discord Bot
 The official gitbhub repository for the Mutee Discord bot.

## How to use the bot
To begin, you must make sure the bot is invited to your server. You can invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=732011296286965821&permissions=406973456&scope=bot). Once you have done that, you can **setup the bot using `.setup`** (administrator only). The bot will create a new role called 'Muted' and change it's permissions in all channels on the server. The bot will instruct you with a gif image explaining to move both the bots role and muted role as high in the servers role hierarchy as possible. This will allow the bot to function on all members of the server. Once the setup is complete, **Users with `mute_members` permission are able to use the bots mute/unmute commands.**
